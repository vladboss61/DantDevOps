Create a user named "bob".
Add the created user to the sudo group (so that they can run commands as an
administrator).
Create a script in the /home/bob/ directory that, when executed, will change the
hostname to "ubuntu22". The script's execution attributes should be set exclusively for the user "bob".
Run the script. Reboot the system. Log into the system as the "bob"
user.
Install "nginx". Check if nginx is running, also use netstat to see which ports are
open.
Submit the result of your work to your GitHub repository, then add a link to the
folder with the completed task in the response to this task.
