TASK 12

To Do
docker-compose.yml

Part 1
Create a docker-compose.yml file based on Homework 11. In this file, you need to set up a service called app using the Docker image from Homework 11. The Docker image for app should be built dynamically using docker-compose.

Part 2
In addition, set up an nginx service and configure it as a reverse proxy to the app service, handling requests on HTTP port 8080. The nginx configuration should be located at /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf inside the container.

As a result, you should push your docker-compose.yml, nginx configuration file, source code of your application and screenshots demonstrating that the setup works (e.g., a successful request made to the nginx proxy).
