Project 2

Task
* Create a test GitHub repository with a Node.js app from forStep2.
* Create a test account in Docker Hub (free): Docker Hub
* Using Vagrant, create two VMs: one for the Jenkins server and the second for the Jenkins worker.

* Manually or in the Vagrant file, add installation of Docker and Docker Compose on the first VM.
* Manually or using the Vagrant file, add installation of Docker and Jenkins worker directly on the second VM (without Docker).
* Connect the Jenkins worker to the master node. Check that you can run a test pipeline on the Jenkins worker.

Add credentials with your Docker Hub username and password to Jenkins credentials.

Create a test pipeline using the Groovy language, which will start when you push to the repository from task 1. The pipeline must:

* Pull the code.
* Build the Docker image on the Jenkins worker.
* Run the Docker image with tests.
* If the tests are successful, log in to your Docker Hub account using Jenkins credentials from step 7 and push the built image to Docker Hub.
* If the tests fail, print the message "Tests failed".
