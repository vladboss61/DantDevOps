Task
Create Terraform code to run two EC2 instances

Terraform must automatically prepare an Ansible inventory file

Write an Ansible playbook that:

Installs Docker
Installs Docker Compose
Pulls the Nginx image
Runs Nginx with Docker Compose
Apply the Ansible playbook manually. It should deploy everything on both EC2 instances
