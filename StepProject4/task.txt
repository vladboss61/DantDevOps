1. Creating a simple application

●      Use Python programming language to create a simple web application with MySQL database

●      Create a Dockerfile to build a container image of your application.

Note: you can reuse the same application from module 8.


2. Setting up a Kubernetes Cluster

●      MiniKube:

○      Install MiniKube on your local machine to create a single-node Kubernetes cluster.

○      Start the cluster using minikube start.

●      Kubernetes Configuration Files:

○      Create YAML files to define your application's deployment, service, and other resources.


3. Deploying the Application

●      Use kubectl to apply your YAML files to the Kubernetes cluster.

●      Check the status of your deployment and service using kubectl get pods and kubectl get services.


4. Integrating with GitLab

●      Configure GitLab CI/CD to automatically build, test, and deploy your application to Kubernetes.

●      Create a GitLab CI/CD pipeline using a .gitlab-ci.yml file.


5. Persistent Volumes

●      Create a persistent volume claim (PVC) to request storage for your application.

●      Create a persistent volume (PV) to provision storage for the PVC.

●      Mount the PV to your application's pod.
