Task Network AWS

- Create a VPC (New VPC with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16)

- Next, we'll create two subnet groups: one public and one private.

- Create two subnet groups: public and private

- Public Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24
- Private Subnet: 10.0.2.0/24
- Add Security Groups for SSH (22) port for access.

- Create one EC2 instance in the public subnet and one EC2 instance in the private subnet

- Ensure that the EC2 instance in the public subnet is accessible over the internet, allowing you to connect via SSH

- Ensure that the EC2 instance in the private subnet is not accessible from the internet but is accessible from the EC2 instance in the public subnet

- Ensure that the EC2 instance in the private subnet has access to the internet

- Add Internet Gateway to Access Internet (from and to internet from instance).
  Add record to a route table with destination 0.0.0.0/0 and target the Internet Gateway.
- Add NAT gateway to allow access internet (from instance)

* Help 1
    Ensure the route table associated with your private subnet (10.0.2.0/24) has a default route (0.0.0.0/0) targeting a NAT Gateway or a NAT instance
    in a public subnet to allow outbound internet traffic from the private subnet.

* Help 2 
    To allow the private instance to access the internet (e.g., for updates):
    Create a NAT Gateway or use a NAT instance in the public subnet.
    Configure the private subnet's route table:
    Add a route to send all internet-bound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the NAT Gateway or NAT instance.

Verification and Testing in the end
Public Instance: Accessible over SSH from your IP address or any allowed IP range.
Private Instance: Not accessible directly from the internet. You should be able to SSH into this instance from the public instance using its private IP address.
