To Do
Dockerfile
Part 1
Create `Dockerfile` for REST API from HOMEWORK 10. You need to select guvicorn as the web server to run the API and configure it to run at 0.0.0.0:8000. The base image in the Dockerfile can be anything you choose.

Part 2
Build image from your Dockerfile, run the container with docker run command and demonstrate the functionality of the image by making a request (get, post, put - on your choice) with Postman to the container.

As a result, you should push your REST API, requirements.txt, Dockerfile, .dockerignore and screenshots of Postman query execution.
